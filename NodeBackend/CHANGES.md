## OTP Generation Fix - [Date]

### Problem
The OTP (One-Time Password) was not being generated during the KYC verification process. This was preventing users from completing the mobile verification step required for KYC.

### Root Cause
The frontend was using test endpoints (`/auth/send-otp-test` and `/auth/verify-otp-test`) that didn't exist in the backend. Additionally, the error handling was insufficient, as it was silently returning mock responses instead of properly handling API errors.

### Solution
1. Updated the frontend API service to use the correct endpoints:
   - Changed from `/auth/send-otp-test` to `/auth/send-otp`
   - Changed from `/auth/verify-otp-test` to `/auth/verify-otp`

2. Improved error handling:
   - Removed mock responses that were masking real errors
   - Added proper error propagation to the calling code
   - Enhanced error messages to be more descriptive

3. Enhanced the KYC.jsx component:
   - Added better validation for mobile number
   - Improved error feedback for users
   - Added logging of OTP for testing purposes
   - Cleared OTP input field when resending OTP

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/services/api.js`: Updated API endpoints and error handling
- `frontend/src/pages/KYC.jsx`: Improved error handling and user feedback

### Testing
The fix was tested by:
1. Starting the frontend server
2. Navigating to the KYC verification flow
3. Verifying that OTP is now properly generated and sent
4. Confirming that error messages are properly displayed when issues occur
