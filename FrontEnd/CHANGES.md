# KYC Verification Flow Changes

## Issue Fixed: Missing Button After Mobile Verification Instructions (Update)

### Date: 2024-07-30

### Problem
After completing the mobile verification step in the KYC process, users were unable to proceed because there was no button visible to start the verification process. The button was incorrectly placed only in the footer section of the modal, which was causing confusion.

### Solution
1. Added the "Start KYC Verification" button directly in the instructions section with proper styling
2. Removed the duplicate button from the footer section of the OTP modal
3. Maintained the Cancel button in the footer for better user experience

### Update (2024-07-30)
After further testing, we found that the button was still missing in some cases. We made the following additional changes:

1. Added a "Proceed to Verification" button in the OTP modal after verification
2. The button appears alongside the Cancel button when OTP is verified
3. Added proper styling for the new button with `.proceed-btn` class
4. Ensured the button calls `startActualVerification()` function with proper error handling

### Files Modified
- `n:\FaceLive\frontend\src\pages\KYC.jsx`

### Changes Made
1. Added a button container with proper styling in the instructions section
2. Added the "Start KYC Verification" button with the same functionality as before
3. Simplified the footer section to only show the Cancel button after OTP verification

These changes ensure that users can clearly see how to proceed after completing the mobile verification step in the KYC process.
